Review of bowel movements in the last 14 days ending August 29 revealed that the resident continues to have irregular bowel pattern. She had only moved her bowels on 5 out of 14 days. Prune juice has been added by the RD to address constipation on August 8 and Lactulose 15 ml PO BID has also been ordered by the physician on August 12, 2025. Recommend continuing to monitor bowel pattern and notify the NP/physician if bowel pattern continues to be an issue so it can be addressed accordingly. Continue to encourage fluid intake to aid with bowel regularity. 2. The resident continues to exhibit signs of pain, PAINAD scores revealed that resident is experiencing mild to moderate pain. PRN Tylenol has been used 7x since last follow up and all were marked effective. Administration time are between 1430 to 2100. The resident had also complained of pain to her feet and continues to have leg edema. A. Recommend to review recent PRN usage with NP/physician to determine if the resident would benefit from around the clock pain management for optimal pain control. (E.g. Acetaminophen 1200 and 1700) Fluctuating pain levels can lead to stress, anxiety, irritability, and increased focus on pain, which may worsen the perception of discomfort and trigger personal expressions. B. Continue to actively monitor the resident for pain using the PAINAD tool and utilize available PRN Analgesics as needed. 3. The resident continues to exhibit refusal and physical and verbal expressions during care. The BSO Lead Team PSW will collaborate and schedule a supportive observation visit with the IBSO team to identify additional environmental or psychosocial factors contributing to the resident’s expressions during care. The goal is to develop individualized, resident-centered strategies that promote comfort, autonomy, and emotional well-being. 4. Continue to ensure that all team members and especially 1:1 team members supporting the resident have reviewed the resident’s plan of care to ensure they have the appropriate tools prior to supporting the resident. IBSO Team to continue reviewing expectations with 1:1 and reiterating importance of providing resident supervision at ALL TIMES to ensure resident’s and others’ safety.

Recommend trialing the following strategies to encourage the resident to take her medications: Assess the resident’s mood prior to offeringscheduled medications to determine if timing is best. Offer medications in small amounts and prioritize the most essential medications first. Trial offering medications along with a food/drink of choice. Provide extra time and patience, avoiding pressure. Use stop and go as necessary. The resident’s Brexpiprazole was recently increased to 3 mg OD, it may take some time for the medication to show its therapeutic benefits and effectiveness may also depend on medication compliance. Continue monitoring and documenting resident’s personal expressions and record any changes in intensity and/or frequency.
